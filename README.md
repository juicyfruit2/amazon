# amazon

Follow these steps:
- Create a Python file called amazon.py in your folder.
- Write code to read the content of the text file input.txt.

- For each line in input.txt, write a new line in the new text file output.txt that computes the answer to some operation on a list of numbers.
- If the input.txt has the following:
- Min: 1,2,3,5,6 o Max: 1,2,3,5,6 o Avg: 1,2,3,5,6
- Your program should generate output.txt as follows:
- The min of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 1. o The max of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 6.
- The avg of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 3.4.
- Assume that the only operations given in the input file are min, max, and avg, and that the operation is always followed by a list of comma-separated integers.
- You should define the functions min, max, and avg that take in a list of integers and return the min, max, or avg of the list.
- Your program should handle any combination of operations and any length of input numbers.
- You can assume that the list of input numbers are always valid integers and that the list is never empty, so as not to have to write code to check for these cases.
- Hint: there is something strange about the first line of input.txt.
